**PMI ANALYSIS**



| Platform     |  Plus |  Minus |  Implication |
|--------------|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Spotify**  | Spotify makes listening feel personal. It learns your taste and delivers playlists and recommendations that often feel spot-on. With smooth syncing across devices and a massive music and podcast library, it’s easy to get lost in sound. This is what makes this application so great | The free version interrupts with ads, which can break the vibe. It’s also not very social, sharing music feels clunky. And sometimes, the recommendations may be on your previous interests, which makes it less . | Spotify could benefit from more community-driven features like collaborative playlists or music circles. Mixing algorithmic suggestions with human-curated content could make discovery more exciting and authentic. |
| **Instagram**| Instagram is visually addictive, with tools like Reels and Stories that make content creation fun and fast. It’s a powerful platform for creators to build audiences and express themselves creatively. | The algorithm can bury smaller voices, and the constant comparison culture can take a toll on mental health. It also lacks depth when it comes to long-form storytelling or meaningful conversations. | Instagram should explore features that support emotional well-being and give users more control over what they see. Adding richer storytelling formats could help deepen engagement and reduce superficial scrolling. |
| **YouTube**  | YouTube is a treasure trove of content—from tutorials to entertainment—and gives creators real opportunities to earn and grow. Its search and recommendation tools make it easy to find what you’re looking for. | Ads can be overwhelming, especially for casual viewers. The platform struggles with moderation, and new users might feel lost in the sea of content. | YouTube could improve the onboarding experience and make content discovery more intuitive. Supporting niche communities and refining ad delivery could make the platform more welcoming and user-friendly. |

# Secondary Research 

Teens today are navigating a world that’s more complex and emotionally demanding than ever. Between academic pressure, social media, climate anxiety, and the lingering effects of the pandemic, many young people are feeling overwhelmed. A recent global report from the Lancet Commission on Adolescent Health warned that mental health issues, obesity, and emotional stress are rising fast among teens—and Australia is no exception. Young people here are reporting higher levels of anxiety, low self-esteem, and difficulty coping with everyday challenges. It’s not just about feeling sad or stressed; it’s about not knowing where to turn or how to process what they’re going through.

At the same time, digital platforms—while offering connection—can also make things worse. Apps like TikTok and Instagram have been called out for promoting addictive scrolling and unrealistic standards, which can fuel comparison and self-doubt. According to the Youth Mental Health Tracker, nearly half of young Australians aged 10–24 have struggled with mental health in the past two years, and a significant number have experienced self-harm or thoughts of it. That’s where your app comes in. A space for self-reflection, milestone tracking, and emotional journaling could give teens a healthier outlet. Instead of doomscrolling, they’d have a tool that helps them pause, reflect, and grow. Features like mood check-ins, guided prompts, and progress milestones could help them feel more in control—and remind them that even small steps forward matter.
