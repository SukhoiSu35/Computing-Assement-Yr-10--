"An Impact vs Effort Matrix is a decision-making tool that helps prioritize tasks based on their potential impact and the effort required to complete them. It is a 2x2 grid that categorizes tasks into four quadrants:"

Below is the Impact / Effort Matrix which has organised my choice of apps on a cartesian plane.

Swot Analysis

"SWOT analysis is a strategic planning tool used to identify the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to a project or business endeavor. Strengths and weaknesses are internal factors, while opportunities and threats are external. This analysis helps in understanding our current position and aids in strategic decision-making."

Below is the worked swot analysis which has been filled by my friends and family. This was done to see the pros and cons of my two choices of apps.

**Requirements Outline**


Functional Requirements 

- A daily motivational quote should appear on the homepage, giving users instant inspiration each time they visit.

- Users should be able to 

- The site should include a quote library with categories (e.g., Success, Leadership, Happiness, Focus) to help users quickly find the type of motivation they’re looking for.

- Users should be able to like or save their favorite quotes, allowing them to build a personal collection for easy access later.

- Sharing options (copy, download, or social media) are needed so that motivation can be spread beyond the app and into users’ networks.

Non-Functional Requirements

- Pages must load in under two seconds to prevent users from losing interest.

- Random quote generation should feel instant, making the interaction smooth and enjoyable.

- A clean, minimal interface is required to keep the focus on the quotes themselves.

- The design must be responsive across desktop and mobile, ensuring accessibility for all users.

- Simple navigation is necessary so visitors can easily switch between the daily quote and the full library.

- User data such as favorites or profiles must be safeguarded, ensuring trust and confidence in the platform.

- Readable fonts and strong text contrast are needed to support users with visual challenges.

- Alt text for images and backgrounds should be provided so screen readers can describe visual elements.

- Keyboard navigation support ensures the site can be used effectively without a mouse.

# Researching And Planning

PMI ANALYSIS



| Platform     |  Plus |  Minus |  Implication |
|--------------|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Spotify**  | Spotify makes listening feel personal. It learns your taste and delivers playlists and recommendations that often feel spot-on. With smooth syncing across devices and a massive music and podcast library, it’s easy to get lost in sound. This is what makes this application so great | The free version interrupts with ads, which can break the vibe. It’s also not very social, sharing music feels clunky. And sometimes, the recommendations may be on your previous interests, which makes it less . | Spotify could benefit from more community-driven features like collaborative playlists or music circles. Mixing algorithmic suggestions with human-curated content could make discovery more exciting and authentic. |
| **Instagram**| Instagram is visually addictive, with tools like Reels and Stories that make content creation fun and fast. It’s a powerful platform for creators to build audiences and express themselves creatively. | The algorithm can bury smaller voices, and the constant comparison culture can take a toll on mental health. It also lacks depth when it comes to long-form storytelling or meaningful conversations. | Instagram should explore features that support emotional well-being and give users more control over what they see. Adding richer storytelling formats could help deepen engagement and reduce superficial scrolling. |
| **YouTube**  | YouTube is a treasure trove of content—from tutorials to entertainment—and gives creators real opportunities to earn and grow. Its search and recommendation tools make it easy to find what you’re looking for. | Ads can be overwhelming, especially for casual viewers. The platform struggles with moderation, and new users might feel lost in the sea of content. | YouTube could improve the onboarding experience and make content discovery more intuitive. Supporting niche communities and refining ad delivery could make the platform more welcoming and user-friendly. |
 
 **Secondary Research** 

Teens today are navigating a world that’s more complex and emotionally demanding than ever. Between academic pressure, social media, climate anxiety, and the lingering effects of the pandemic, many young people are feeling overwhelmed. A recent global report from the Lancet Commission on Adolescent Health warned that mental health issues, obesity, and emotional stress are rising fast among teens—and Australia is no exception. Young people here are reporting higher levels of anxiety, low self-esteem, and difficulty coping with everyday challenges. It’s not just about feeling sad or stressed; it’s about not knowing where to turn or how to process what they’re going through.

At the same time, digital platforms, while offering connection—can also make things worse. Apps like TikTok and Instagram have been called out for promoting addictive scrolling and unrealistic standards, which can fuel comparison and self-doubt. According to the Youth Mental Health Tracker, nearly half of young Australians aged 10–24 have struggled with mental health in the past two years, and a significant number have experienced self-harm or thoughts of it. That’s where your app comes in. A space for self-reflection, milestone tracking, and emotional journaling could give teens a healthier outlet. Instead of doomscrolling, they’d have a tool that helps them pause, reflect, and grow. Features like mood check-ins, guided prompts, and progress milestones could help them feel more in control—and remind them that even small steps forward matter.


**Primary Research**

Primary Research Results & Evaluation

I conducted a survey with 20 participants to understand stress levels and how motivational quotes are currently used. The results showed that 35% of people rated their stress as 10/10, while another 30% rated it at 3/10, suggesting that stress levels vary widely and that some people experience it far more intensely than others. This highlights the importance of creating an app that can support users across different stress levels with flexible features.

When asked about motivational quotes, 45% of respondents said they rarely see quotes that motivate them, while 15% said they see them very often (10/10). This tells me that although some people are surrounded by motivational content, for many it is not consistent or accessible. My app can help fill this gap by delivering regular, personalised quotes to those who need more frequent encouragement.

The final question confirmed this: 55% of respondents said they don’t see any motivational quotes around them at all, while only 20% said they see 1–5. This shows a clear opportunity for my app, as most people don’t currently encounter motivational content in their daily lives.

Overall, my research made it clear that Australians do experience stress but aren’t regularly exposed to motivational content that could support them. Moving forward, I will design my app to provide daily motivational quotes combined with customisable reminders, so users can control how often they engage with the app without feeling overwhelmed.


**UI / UX Design**

To design the user interface for my motivational app, I created and compared alternative designs using wireframes and storyboards. I sketched out different layouts on paper to explore ideas quickly, before moving on to digital prototypes in Figma.

My first design option had a homepage focused only on a daily quote, with a minimal layout and a single “next quote” button. The strength of this design was its simplicity, but the weakness was that it didn’t encourage deeper engagement.

My second design option included a homepage with tabs for “Daily Quote,” “Habit Tracker,” and “Saved Quotes.” This design gave users more functionality but risked feeling cluttered if too many features were added.

My final storyboard combined the strengths of both. It used a clean homepage with the daily quote at the centre, but also included subtle navigation buttons for habits and saved content. This design was more balanced, keeping the interface simple but still allowing users to explore features if they wanted.

After evaluating these options, I chose the final storyboard design because it aligns best with my survey results. Users wanted motivational quotes as the main feature, but they also valued reminders and tracking progress. This design makes motivational quotes the focus while still providing easy access to additional features.
