"An Impact vs Effort Matrix is a decision-making tool that helps prioritize tasks based on their potential impact and the effort required to complete them. It is a 2x2 grid that categorizes tasks into four quadrants:"

Below is the Impact / Effort Matrix which has organised my choice of apps on a cartesian plane.

Swot Analysis

"SWOT analysis is a strategic planning tool used to identify the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats related to a project or business endeavor. Strengths and weaknesses are internal factors, while opportunities and threats are external. This analysis helps in understanding our current position and aids in strategic decision-making."

Below is the worked swot analysis which has been filled by my friends and family. This was done to see the pros and cons of my two choices of apps.

**Requirements Outline**

Requirements Outline:
o Outline functional and non-functional requirements for your website / app.

Functional Requirements 

- A daily motivational quote should appear on the homepage, giving users instant inspiration each time they visit.

- The site should include a quote library with categories (e.g., Success, Leadership, Happiness, Focus) to help users quickly find the type of motivation they’re looking for.

- A random quote generator button is important, as it keeps the experience fresh and engaging without requiring manual browsing.

- Users should be able to like or save their favorite quotes, allowing them to build a personal collection for easy access later.

- Sharing options (copy, download, or social media) are needed so that motivation can be spread beyond the app and into users’ networks.

Non-Functional Requirements

- Pages must load in under two seconds to prevent users from losing interest.

- Random quote generation should feel instant, making the interaction smooth and enjoyable.

- A clean, minimal interface is required to keep the focus on the quotes themselves.

- The design must be responsive across desktop and mobile, ensuring accessibility for all users.

- Simple navigation is necessary so visitors can easily switch between the daily quote and the full library.

- User data such as favorites or profiles must be safeguarded, ensuring trust and confidence in the platform.

- Readable fonts and strong text contrast are needed to support users with visual challenges.

- Alt text for images and backgrounds should be provided so screen readers can describe visual elements.

- Keyboard navigation support ensures the site can be used effectively without a mouse.

PMI ANALYSIS



| Platform     |  Plus |  Minus |  Implication |
|--------------|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Spotify**  | Spotify makes listening feel personal. It learns your taste and delivers playlists and recommendations that often feel spot-on. With smooth syncing across devices and a massive music and podcast library, it’s easy to get lost in sound. This is what makes this application so great | The free version interrupts with ads, which can break the vibe. It’s also not very social, sharing music feels clunky. And sometimes, the recommendations may be on your previous interests, which makes it less . | Spotify could benefit from more community-driven features like collaborative playlists or music circles. Mixing algorithmic suggestions with human-curated content could make discovery more exciting and authentic. |
| **Instagram**| Instagram is visually addictive, with tools like Reels and Stories that make content creation fun and fast. It’s a powerful platform for creators to build audiences and express themselves creatively. | The algorithm can bury smaller voices, and the constant comparison culture can take a toll on mental health. It also lacks depth when it comes to long-form storytelling or meaningful conversations. | Instagram should explore features that support emotional well-being and give users more control over what they see. Adding richer storytelling formats could help deepen engagement and reduce superficial scrolling. |
| **YouTube**  | YouTube is a treasure trove of content—from tutorials to entertainment—and gives creators real opportunities to earn and grow. Its search and recommendation tools make it easy to find what you’re looking for. | Ads can be overwhelming, especially for casual viewers. The platform struggles with moderation, and new users might feel lost in the sea of content. | YouTube could improve the onboarding experience and make content discovery more intuitive. Supporting niche communities and refining ad delivery could make the platform more welcoming and user-friendly. |
 
 **Secondary Research** 

Teens today are navigating a world that’s more complex and emotionally demanding than ever. Between academic pressure, social media, climate anxiety, and the lingering effects of the pandemic, many young people are feeling overwhelmed. A recent global report from the Lancet Commission on Adolescent Health warned that mental health issues, obesity, and emotional stress are rising fast among teens—and Australia is no exception. Young people here are reporting higher levels of anxiety, low self-esteem, and difficulty coping with everyday challenges. It’s not just about feeling sad or stressed; it’s about not knowing where to turn or how to process what they’re going through.

At the same time, digital platforms, while offering connection—can also make things worse. Apps like TikTok and Instagram have been called out for promoting addictive scrolling and unrealistic standards, which can fuel comparison and self-doubt. According to the Youth Mental Health Tracker, nearly half of young Australians aged 10–24 have struggled with mental health in the past two years, and a significant number have experienced self-harm or thoughts of it. That’s where your app comes in. A space for self-reflection, milestone tracking, and emotional journaling could give teens a healthier outlet. Instead of doomscrolling, they’d have a tool that helps them pause, reflect, and grow. Features like mood check-ins, guided prompts, and progress milestones could help them feel more in control—and remind them that even small steps forward matter.
